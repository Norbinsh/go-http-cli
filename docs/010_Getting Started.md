## Getting Started

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/visola/go-http-cli/releases) for your platform.

Unzip it and put all three binaries in you path adding something like this to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/extracted/root
```

There's also an auto-completion helper for bash. You can add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
complete -f -C go-http-completion http
```
